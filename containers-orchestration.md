## What is Docker Compose?

Docker Compose is a containers orchestration. When using Docker extensively, the management of serveral different containers quickly becomes cumbersome. Docker Compose (or any other containers orchestration, like Kubernetes) is a tool that helps overcoming this problem and easily handle multiple containers at once.  

Docker Compose works by applying many rules declared within a single `docker-compose.yaml` configuration file.
